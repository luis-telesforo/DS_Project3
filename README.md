# Project 3: A low cost alternative to cross validation

* If we want to find the best model out of 1000 different models using a 5-fold cross validation we need to train 5000 models. We present an alternative that uses a hypothesis test and only requires to train 1000 models. Thus, we decrease computational costs by 80%.
